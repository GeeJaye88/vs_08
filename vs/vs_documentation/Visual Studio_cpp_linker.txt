SET SYSTEM PATH
===============

Windows 7, etc...

1. Right-click on the My Computer icon.
2. Choose Properties from the context menu.
(Alternatively, you can double-click on the System icon in the Control Panel)
4. Click the Advanced tab or "Advanced system settings" on Windows Vista or Windows 7
5. Click the Environment Variables button.
6. Click on the variable called 'Path' and then click on Edit. Now add the target directory to the value of the variable, using a semi-colon as a separator.

For example, if you want to add the path to ffmpeg/lib to your system, which if located at c:\ffmpeg\lib, you would enter the following at the end of the Path:

C:\ffmpeg\lib;

OR, another example:

C:\Users\Gareth\bin\;
